# Idea
- To take a seed, randomize a list, loaded/fed in from a file, then output links to hide people from who their secret santa is.

# Needs/TODOs
- [ ] Have a page that you can add and remove the participants? 
     * This will cause problems and there will be a need to issue out new picks to people. 
     * Have the person who's removed give their choice to their secret santa.
- [x] Load in a file to get urlStarter, TheList, the message to send in "to.ejs", the seed, and the participants.
- [x] Check and use defaults for any missing data that the user didn't provide.
- [ ] Check if the user got a unique URL from the rest.
- [ ] In the setup function, shorten it by using another for loop?
- [ ] Add Holiday designs to web pages.
- [x] Clean up code.
- [x] Document Code.
