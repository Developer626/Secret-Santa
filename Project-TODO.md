# Idea
- To take a seed, randomize a list, loaded/fed in from a file, then output links to hide people from who their secret santa is.

# Needs/TODOs
// - Have a page that you can add and remove the participants? 
//      This will cause problems and there will be a need to issue out new picks to people. 
//      Have the person who's removed give their choice to their secret santa.
// - (Done) Load in a file to get urlStarter, TheList, the message to send in "to.ejs", the seed, and the participants.
// - (Done) Check and use defaults for any missing data that the user didn't provide.
// - Check if the user got a unique URL from the rest.
// - In the setup function, shorten it by using another for loop?
// - Add Holiday designs to web pages.
// - (Done) Clean up code.
// - (Done) Document Code.
